你说好不好？

I would add some codes, like below, to my blog if I could and please do check my [Github][github] if you would like to know what I did.

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Anyway, thanks for reading.
