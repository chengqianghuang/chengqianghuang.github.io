Hi there,

Welcome to my blog. As described in my profile, I am an anomaly detection guy who is interested in using data mining, machine learning, or related methods. Most of the articles in my blog are related to these topics. From basic theoretical foundations to practical applications, I would write about a lot of different things. Please bear with me if I cannot explain things clearly enough. And please understand that my primary purpose of writing is to consolidate my understanding of techniques. Therefore, I may sometimes use Chinese to help myself understand thoroughly.

I would add some codes, like below, to my blog if I could and please do check my [Github][github] if you would like to know what I did.

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Anyway, thanks for reading.
